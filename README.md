### Hi there 👋

- 👋 Hi, I’m @LawrenceKm

- 👀 I’m interested in:
* Software design and development at scale
* Web Design and Development
* Reversibility. When you can unlearn and re-learn, then you can as well do more of it.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with cleaner tidier coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CI/CD, economics for creators.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a smpp to http bridge
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on non-profits projects and laravel projects.
- ⚡ Fact: first solve the problem, then write the code.
- 💞️ How to reach me: lawrencekm04@gmail.com
- 💬 Ask me about software design & development
