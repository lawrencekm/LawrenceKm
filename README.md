### Hi there 👋

- 👋 I’m @LawrenceKm

- 👀 I’m interested in:  Software design and development at scale. Web Design and Development. Tradeoffs and tackles of changes affecting development as a product matures. Adapting our tools and techniques to the inexorable laws of nature and power law distributions. How to coach, scale it, teach it, and measure it.
    
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with cleaner tidier coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CI/CD, economics for creators.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a smpp to http bridge
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on non-profits projects and laravel projects.
- ⚡ Fact: first solve the problem, then write the code.
- 💞️ How to reach me: lawrencekm04@gmail.com
