### Hi there 👋

- 👋 Hi, I’m @LawrenceKm

- 👀 I’m interested in:
    Software design and development at scale, Web Design and Development
    Explore/Expand/Extract. As a product matures, the tradeoffs affecting its development change dramatically. What are these changes and how can we respond to them?
    Power law distributions. Power laws appear despite our best efforts. How should we adapt our tools and techniques to the inexorable laws of nature.
    Coaching. How to deliver it, scale it, teach it, and measure it.
    Reversibility. When you can unlearn and re-learn, then you can as well do more of it.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with cleaner tidier coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CI/CD, economics for creators.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a smpp to http bridge
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on non-profits projects and laravel projects.
- ⚡ Fact: first solve the problem, then write the code.
