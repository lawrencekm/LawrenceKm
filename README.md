### Hi there 👋

- 👋 Hi, I’m @LawrenceKm

- 👀 I’m interested in:
    Software design and development at scale
    Explore/Expand/Extract. As a product matures, the tradeoffs affecting its development change dramatically. What are these changes and how can we respond to them?
    Power law distributions. Power laws appear despite our best efforts. How should we adapt our tools and techniques to the inexorable laws of nature.
    Coaching. How to deliver it, scale it, teach it, and measure it.
    Reversibility. When you can un-make decisions, then you can afford to make many more of them.
    Software design and development
